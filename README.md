#### PolyominoSolver is an online mathematical tool capable of automatically performing polyomino fitting.

It features a set of screens and tools intended to make it easy and fast to solve a polyfit problem for any custom set of polyominoes in any custom shape of field.

## *"What's polyomino fitting?"*

Polyomino fitting is some what self-explanatory. You have a region that you want to put a set of polyominoes in. Polyomino fitting then, is finding some orientation of your polyominoes that will fit within that region, without overlap or sitting outside of the region. [Like this.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Pentomino_Puzzle_Solutions.svg/400px-Pentomino_Puzzle_Solutions.svg.png)

Of course, not all fields are rectangular, and not all polyominoes are pentominoes (polyominoes with five squares).

## *"Why would I want this done automatically?"*

Fitting problems for a person to complete are mostly a matter of trial and error with only a little bit of intuition. For larger polyominoes and oddly-shaped fields, the ability for a person to find a solution to the problem can get daunting. This program intends to mimic that process extremely quickly, except it brute forces solutions with a few smart shortcuts.
